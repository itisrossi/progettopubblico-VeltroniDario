netstat                                          is a classic networking tool that provides information about network connections, ports in use, routing tables, and network interface statistics

sudo fdisk -l | grep xvda             explained--->
sudo                                             to run commands with superuser (root) privileges
fdisk -l                                         the fdisk command is a utility for disk partitioning. The -l option (or --list) tells fdisk to list the partition tables for all available disks.
|                                                   This is a pipe operator. It takes the output of the command on its left (fdisk -l) and passes it as input to the command on its right (grep xvda).
grep xvda                                    The grep command searches through text. In this case, it filters the output from fdisk -l to show only lines containing the string "xvda".
"sudo fdisk -l" lists the partition tables of all disks and then the output is piped (|) to "grep xvda", which filters and displays only the lines that contain "xvda".


 ps -e                                            to see a list of the active running processes.

openssl genpkey -algorithm rsa -out keyforjohn.key                     explained--->
openssl: This is the command-line tool for OpenSSL, which provides various cryptographic operations.
genpkey                                       is used to generate private keys. It is a more recent and flexible command compared to the older genrsa.
-algorithm RSA                            it specifies the algorithm to use for generating the private key. In this case, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely-used encryption and authentication algorithm.
-out keyforjohn.key                    output
Putting it all together, this command generates a new RSA private key and saves it in a file named keyforjohn.key.

base64 keyforjohn.key > keyforjohn.send             explained-->
base64                                        This is a command-line utility that encodes or decodes data in Base64 format.
keyforjohn.key                          This is the input file, which contains the RSA private key generated in the previous step.
>                                                    This is the redirection operator in the shell. It takes the output of the command on its left and writes it to the file specified on its right.
keyforjohn.send                        This is the output file where the Base64-encoded content of keyforjohn.key will be saved.

base64 -d keyforjohn.base64 > keyfromcybrary.key                 to decode the shared key.

cat keyforjohn.send | mail -s "For John" john           explained-->
cat keyforjohn.send                   This part of the command reads the contents of the file keyforjohn.send and outputs it to the standard output (the terminal or the next command in the pipeline).
|                                                       This is the pipe operator. It takes the output of the command on its left (cat keyforjohn.send) and passes it as input to the command on its right (mail -s "For John" john).
mail -s "For John" john                This is the mail command used to send emails. The -s "For John" option specifies the subject of the email, and john is the recipient's email address.
Encoding and encrypting are not the same thing. Encoding allows us to send things using mail that would not be possible otherwise.

openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -inkey keyfromcybrary.key -in message.txt -out message.enc         explained-->
Read the Public Key:
OpenSSL reads the public key from the file specified by -inkey keyfromcybrary.key.
Read the Plaintext Message:
OpenSSL reads the plaintext message from the file specified by -in message.txt.
Encrypt the Message:
OpenSSL encrypts the plaintext message using the public key. The encryption method depends on the algorithm specified or implied by the key type (e.g., RSA).
Write the Encrypted Message:
OpenSSL writes the encrypted message to the file specified by -out message.enc

su - john                                      for switch account to john

sintax to create a private key:
openssl genpkey -algorithm rsa -out fileprivate.key
sintax to create o public key:
openssl rsa -pubout -in fileprivate.key -out filepublic.key
So then to encrypt a message:
openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -inkey [public].key -pubin -in filetoencript.txt -out fileencripted.enc
Ando to decrypt a message:
openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey [private].key -in fileencripted.enc -out filetoencript.txt

sudo cp cybrarypublic.key /var/www/html                           to copy the public key to the /var/www/html directory.
