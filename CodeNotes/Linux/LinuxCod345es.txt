cat unsorted | sort | uniq  explaining-->

base64 /dev/urandom | head -c 1M > abigfile.txt    explaining-->
/dev/urandom     is a special device file in Linux that generates cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes
base64           This filter encodes the binary output from /dev/urandom into a text format using base64 encoding
head -c 1M       This part filters the output from base64  explaining-->
head             This command typically extracts the first part of a file.
-c               The -c option specifies the number of bytes to be read. 
1M               Here, 1M indicates 1 Megabyte of data.
>                This redirection operator directs the output from the previous command
